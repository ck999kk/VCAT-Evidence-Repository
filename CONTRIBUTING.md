Thank you for your interest in contributing to the VCAT Evidence Repository! We value clean code, reproducible tests, and automated checks.

## Getting Started

## Automated Checks (CI)

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically run linters, tests, and validation on each push and pull request. You do not need to watch the screenâ€”CI will inform you of any failures.

### Workflow
- **Lint & Pre-commit hooks**: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- **Unit tests**: `pytest`

If CI passes, your PR is ready for review.

## Writing Code

- Follow existing code style (PEP 8 for Python).
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Update documentation or tests when adding new functionality.

## Pull Request Process

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a Pull Request against `main` branch.
3. CI will run automatically. Fix any issues until checks pass.
4. Request reviews and address feedback.
